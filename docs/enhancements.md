# Enhancements for QuantaDorsa Pipeline

This document lists potential enhancements to the QuantaDorsa pipeline.

### 1. Advanced Visualization

-   **3D Brain Model Integration:** Overlay the simulation results onto a 3D brain model (e.g., using libraries like `brainrender`).
-   **Interactive Plots:** Use libraries like Plotly or Bokeh to create interactive plots where users can zoom, pan, and hover to get more details.
-   **Real-time plotting:** Stream data from the C++ simulation to Python for real-time visualization of synaptic dynamics.

### 2. Deeper Statistical Analysis

-   **Machine Learning Integration:** Use ML models (e.g., clustering, classification) to identify patterns in synaptic behavior across regions.
-   **Time-series analysis:** Apply advanced time-series analysis techniques to understand the temporal dynamics of synapses.
-   **Network analysis:** Model and visualize the brain regions as a network and analyze their connectivity and information flow.

### 3. Performance and Scalability

-   **Parallelization:** Parallelize the C++ simulation using OpenMP or MPI to run simulations for multiple regions or neurons concurrently.
-   **GPU Acceleration:** Utilize CUDA or OpenCL to accelerate the most computationally intensive parts of the simulation.
-   **Cloud Integration:** Develop scripts to run the pipeline on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for large-scale simulations.

### 4. Extensibility and Usability

-   **GUI Interface:** Create a simple GUI (e.g., with PyQt or Tkinter) to configure and run the pipeline.
-   **Plugin Architecture:** Design a plugin system to make it easier for other researchers to add their own brain models, analysis techniques, and visualizations.
-   **Containerization:** Package the entire pipeline into a Docker container for easy reproduction of the environment and results.

### 5. AI-Enhanced Video Composition

-   **AI-based video smoothing:** Integrate tools like RIFE (Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation) or VapourSynth to interpolate frames and create smoother videos.
-   **Automated video editing:** Use AI to automatically create highlight reels of the most interesting simulation events.
