#
# Description:
# This script provides a demonstration of cognitive modeling by fetching and
# visualizing neuron data from the CATMAID server for the fruit fly connectome.
# It plots Olfactory Receptor Neurons (ORNs) and Projection Neurons (PNs) in 3D.
#
# Inputs:
# - None. Data is fetched directly from the CATMAID server.
#
# Outputs:
# - Two interactive 3D plots showing the ORN and PN neurons.
#
# Dependencies:
# - `catmaid`
# - `rgl`
