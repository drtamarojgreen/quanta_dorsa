# Description:
# This script provides an integrated framework for analyzing mental health conditions
# by combining data from public databases. It demonstrates a conceptual workflow for
# building a knowledge graph from genes, pathways, publications, clinical trials, and drugs.
#
# Inputs:
# - None. This script is a conceptual demonstration and does not execute live API calls.
#
# Outputs:
# - Console messages outlining the conceptual steps of data retrieval and
#   knowledge graph construction.
#
# Dependencies:
# - (Conceptual) Depends on the various data access scripts for PubMed, KEGG,
#   ClinicalTrials.gov, and DailyMed.

# This script provides an integrated framework for analyzing mental health conditions
# by combining data from public databases. It demonstrates a conceptual workflow for
# building a knowledge graph from genes, pathways, publications, clinical trials, and drugs.

# --- 1. Load Dependencies & Access Scripts ---
# In a real workflow, these would be sourced to make their functions available.

# --- 2. Define Core Entities ---
# Start with a target condition and a set of associated genes.

# Identify a drug relevant to the condition and genes.

  # - Trial -> Condition (studies)
  # - Article -> Gene (mentions)
