#
# Description:
# This script provides functions to access the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
# and Genomes) database. It uses the KEGGREST package to find pathways and
# retrieve the genes associated with them.
#
# Inputs:
# - `search_term`: A term to search for KEGG pathways.
# - `pathway_id`: A specific KEGG pathway ID (e.g., "hsa04080").
#
# Outputs:
# - `find_kegg_pathways`: A named character vector of pathway IDs and descriptions.
# - `get_kegg_pathway_details`: A list object containing detailed pathway information.
# - `parse_kegg_genes`: A data frame of genes from a pathway, including EntrezID,
#   Symbol, and Description.
#
# Dependencies:
# - `KEGGREST`

# This script provides functions to access the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
# database. It uses the KEGGREST package to find pathways and genes related to
# mental health conditions.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - KEGGREST: Provides a client for the KEGG REST API.
#
# To install from Bioconductor:
# if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#     install.packages("BiocManager")
# BiocManager::install("KEGGREST")
