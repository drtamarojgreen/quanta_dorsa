#
# Description:
# This script is for data processing and feature engineering. It takes the cleaned
# real BRFSS data and creates new, more insightful variables for analysis, such as
# labeled categorical factors.
#
# Inputs:
# - `cleaned_data`: A data.table object containing the cleaned BRFSS data,
#   typically from the `proc_generic_clean.R` script.
#
# Outputs:
# - A data.table object with new, processed columns ready for analysis.
#
# Dependencies:
# - `data.table`

#
# Objective:
# This script is for data processing and feature engineering. It takes the cleaned
# real BRFSS data and creates new, more insightful variables for analysis.
# This version is adapted to use the actual variable names and codes from the
# 2022 BRFSS dataset.
#
# All steps are fully commented.

# Load required libraries for data manipulation.
library(data.table)

# Source the data cleaning script. This makes all functions from both
# `01_data_access.R` and `02_data_cleaning.R` available here.

#' Process Cleaned BRFSS Data for Analysis
#'
#' @description
#' Performs feature engineering on the cleaned data. This involves creating
#' categorical variables (factors) from numeric codes to make them more
#' interpretable for analysis and visualization.
#'
#' @param cleaned_data A data.table object containing the cleaned BRFSS data.
#'
#' @return A data.table object with new, processed columns.
#'
#' @examples
#' # This example assumes the data has been downloaded and cleaned.

#' cleaned_dt <- clean_brfss_data(raw_dt)
#' processed_dt <- process_brfss_data(cleaned_dt)
#' print(head(processed_dt))
#' print(str(processed_dt)) # Show structure

  # 1. Convert Age Group to a Labeled Factor
  # The `_AGEG5YR` variable is already categorized. We just need to convert it
  # to a factor with meaningful labels.
  # Codebook values: 1=18-24, 2=25-29, ..., 13=80+, 14=Don't know/Refused

                                                "80+"))]

  # 2. Convert Sex to a Labeled Factor
  # The `SEXVAR` variable uses 1 for Male and 2 for Female.
  processed_dt[, SEX_LABEL := factor(SEXVAR,

  # The `ADDEPEV3` variable uses 1 for Yes and 2 for No.
  processed_dt[, DEPRESSION_STATUS := factor(ADDEPEV3,
                                             levels = c(1, 2),
                                             labels = c("Yes", "No"))]

  # 4. Create an indicator for Frequent Mental Distress (FMD)
  # FMD is defined as 14 or more days of poor mental health in the past month.
  # The MENTHLTH variable uses 88 for "None". We will treat that as 0 days.
  processed_dt[MENTHLTH == 88, MENTHLTH := 0]

    `MENTHLTH` >= 14, 1,
    `MENTHLTH` < 14, 0,
    is.na(`MENTHLTH`), NA_integer_
  )]
  # Convert the new indicator to a labeled factor for clarity.
  processed_dt[, FMD_INDICATOR_LABEL := factor(FMD_INDICATOR,
                                                levels = c(0, 1),
                                                labels = c("No FMD", "Frequent Mental Distress"))]
